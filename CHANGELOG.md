# Notes
There have been two issues identified with loot learning and the Tartarus dimension. If Tartarus is not loaded then 
no loot learning can occur.

- Forge earlier than 1.16.4-35.0.15 does not load dimensions on servers for first run.
- Quark realistic terrain causes Tartarus not to load on dedicated servers.
